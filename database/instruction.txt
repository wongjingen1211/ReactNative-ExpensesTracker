1. Ignore the 'CreateDB.py' and 'RecordsDatabase.sqlite' if you dont want to make modification on databasae structure.

2. Make sure the 'RecordsDatabase.sqlite' and 'server.py' placed in the same directory.

3. Make sure your local machine has installed Python and related libraries: 'sqlite3,flask'.

4. Open this directory in Command Prompt, then type 'python server.py'

5. FIRST TIME ONLY: 
  Check your Flask server address on local machine. It can be find at the bottom after you have started Flask server.
  
  Example: * Running on http://192.168.1.192:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  
  Then the 192.168.1.192 is the host, 5000 is the port. 
  Required modification:
  line 356 at server.py.
  line 360 at server.py.
  line 2 at Config.js.
  
!!! sometimes the server might not response to the request and console there shows [TypeError: Network request failed] 
!!!Just return to the previous page then come back again for it to reload.
